---- TERMINOLOGY ----
SSH: Secure Shell
Network protocol used to securely access a computer over an unsecured network.
Either through password auth or a pub/private key auth.

UFW: Uncomplicated FireWall
When UFW is active it allows simple rules to allow/deny access through
certain ports and from certain addresses

su: superuser/substitute user | sudo = "su", do
The root user has su privileges by default, and has permission to access,
modify and run all files in the system.
Any other user needs "sudo privileges" to perform su actions. 
(ex. modifying system files, seeing the status of security sensitive processes)

SDA: Small Computer System Interface disk
the letter behind is purely for denoting which disk it is.
sda = disk 1, sdb = disk 2, etc.
sda1/2/5 are the partitions on disk "a".
Then partition 5 is split into three separate sectors using LVM 
(Logical Volume Manager).
The main benefit of using LVM instead of regular partitions is that LVM 
parts don't have to be physically contiguous or even reside on the same
physical disk.

TTY: TeleTYpewriter, essentially the keyboard you input the commands on.
In the sudo log you can see each sudo command, followed by what TTY the 
command was input on. TTY=tyy are local tty connections, pts are remote/
virtual connections to the system through ssh.
"requiretty" in the sudo config ensures no external processes or services
can run sudo commands.

apt = Advanced Packaging tooling
A package manager that lets you install and remove programs through the 
command line. If you provide a package name with sudo "apt-get" it will
check if the package exists and automatically install all things it's 
dependent on as well.
Aptitude is a packaging tool that has a user interface so it's possibly 
easier to use than apt. It also containt all functionality from apt-get, 
apt-mark, and apt-cache. It overall has more features but is not necessary.

Daemon
A computer program that runs as a background process, as opposed to being
under direct control of a user. 'cron' is a daemon we'll be using for this 
project to a command to display the monitoring script.

---- THE WHY ----
The three parts of sda5 are split into three "logical volumes". These are 
root, home and [SWAP]. The main purpose of the logical volumes is to keep
system and personal files separate with root and home. [SWAP] is used 
in case the system lacks RAM, then it uses the space in [SWAP] as a substitute.

AppArmor is a linux security system that proactively protects the OS from 
all kinds of threats. It can run on "enforce" or "complain" mode. 
Enforce mode blocks specific actions from happening and logs them.
Complain mode only logs any actions it finds objectionable.
These modes are applied on "profiles" in the apparmor.d dir, which 
outline the rules/requirements for the logging to happen.

Why store sudo actions in a separate log file instead of checking the contents 
of /var/log/auth.log?
The default log file, auth.log gets rotated out weekly, and eventually
compressed and deleted by the system (with logrotate). 
This is to ensure the storage does not get bogged down by an endless stream 
of log files over the years. My sudo.log file does not have this problem.

DEBIAN - ROCKY
Deb and Rock use different package managers (apt vs dnf). 
Debian is the Upstream version of Ubuntu, informing Ubuntu's design decisions.
Rocky is Downstream from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the most popular 
commercial Linux distro. Unlike RHEL, Rocky is free to use but is compatible 
with most of RHEL's tooling. 
Rocky/RHEL is mostly used for enterprise purposes, while Debian/Ubuntu is 
more geared towards desktops and home servers.
